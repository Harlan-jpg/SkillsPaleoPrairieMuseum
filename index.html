    <p id="whoWeArePG">Our museum began with a simple but powerful idea: to keep the fossils of western
        Kansas in western Kansas. Nestled in a region rich with prehistoric history, we are
        committed to uncovering, preserving, and showcasing the ancient life that once roamed
        our land.
        It all started when a local dig site uncovered a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of a
        marine reptile, and rather than see it shipped out of state, a small team of paleontology
        enthusiasts and community members worked together to find a way to preserve it locally.
        From that effort grew a mission to support fossil digs in western Kansas and build a
        place where discoveries stay rooted in the land they were found.
        Today, our museum proudly funds archaeological digs, preserves rare fossils, and tells
        the story of Kansas’ ancient life—from the inland sea to the towering dinosaurs that left
        their mark here millions of years ago.</p>

<h2 id="paleontologyHeader">What Is Paleontology?</h2>
<div id="paleontologySection">
    <p id="paleontologyPG">Paleontology is the study of the history of pre-historic life on Earth based off of fossils found 
       in the ground. Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, diffent types of fungi, bacteria, and other 
       single-celled organisms that have been replaced by rocky material or impressions made in the stone by 
       organisms preserved in rock. Talk about getting stuck between a rock and a hard place!

<h2 id="seaHeader">Sea Monsters of the Kansas Inland Sea</h2>
<div id="seaExhibit">
    
    <p id="seaExhibitPG">Step back in time 80 million years when western Kansas was underwater. Explore life in
        the Western Interior Seaway with fossil specimens of mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and giant
        ammonites. Interactive displays show how these marine reptiles hunted, lived, and ruled
        the ancient sea. Our fossils to look for are our: 
        <ul>
            <li>Tylosaurus Skull</li>
            <li>Plesiosaur flipper bones</li>
